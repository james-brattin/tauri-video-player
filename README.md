# Tauri Video Player

A cross-platform desktop app for viewing the videos on your local computer using a browser. I was thinking something like YouTube, but for your own stuff.

## Development

1. Have Rust installed and configured. Instructions [here](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites/)
2. Instal node.js dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start a development build with `npm run tauri dev`
